/* This is the public header file for JavaScriptCore's variant of the PCRE
library. While this library started out as a copy of PCRE, many of the
features of PCRE have been removed. This library now supports only the
regular expression features required by the JavaScript language
specification, and has only the functions needed by JavaScriptCore and the
rest of WebKit.
