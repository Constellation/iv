PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

This is JavaScriptCore's variant of the PCRE library. While this library
started out as a copy of PCRE, many of the features of PCRE have been
removed.
