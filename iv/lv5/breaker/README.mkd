# iv / lv5 / breaker

breaker is ECMAScript JIT module

## Design

This compiler parses railgun::opcodes and emits native code.

Some primitive operations and branch operations are emitted as raw native code,
and basic complex opcodes are emitted as call to stub function,
that is, Context Threading JIT.
